Phase 10 is a popular card game, I don't own the game or anything belongs to it. I just implemented it into a web game to have fun with my friend.
This application is made only for fun and not for any financial or commercial purposes1!
The code is completly mine except the dependencies that I used, so feel free to clone, contribute or fork...

## Build
- First of all you need to clone the repository:
	- Create a folder of your choice.
	- Clone the repository either by downloading it or executing this command:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/T-Caster/Fline.git
	```
---
- Then you need to install the npm packages: 
	- Execute this command:
	```
	npm install
	```

## Start the app
After you followed the steps in the "Build" sections your build should be ready to start:
- Open a terminal and execute that command to pack the frontend:
	```bash
	npm run build
	```
- Open another terminal and execute that command to launch the server:
	```bash
	npm start
	```
## Deployment
Now you are about to finish, you can build your "vue app" and the "sever" then deploy them to anywhere you want ;)
